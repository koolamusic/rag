The founding universities (UQ \\u0026 UM) also committed further funds. Australian Super took over Westscheme\\u0027s essets and commitments in July 2011.\\r\\rWith the start of Fund-2, an independent management team was established, consisting of the CEO and three Investment Managers; one at each university catchment. The Investment Committee was restructured, with dedicated committees established for biotechnology or other technologies. The nominal investment limit was increased to $2.5 million to allow participation in follow-on funding rounds so as to preserve Uniseed\\u0027s equity position.\\r\\rOn 1 November 2015, Uniseed started its third and largest fund (Fund-3) with the addition of the University of Sydney and the CSIRO to the Universities of Queensland, Melbourne and NSW. This followed three high profile exits in the preceding 14 months (Fibrotech; Spinifex \\u0026 Hatchtech). Each of the five partners committed $10 million over 10 years to the new fund (total fund $50 million).\\r\\rUniseed’s partner research organisations spent nearly $4 billion on research, making up over 40% of the total research spend at 67 research organisations in Australia. Together, these organisations accounted for nearly 500 invention disclosures (34% of total) and 500 new registered IP rights filed (45% of total) over the same period(2013 National Survey of Research Commercialisation).\\r\\rUnlike private venture capital funds, Uniseed is dedicated to the needs of its research partners, and committed to servicing them consistently over the long term, irrespective of the short term conditions in external capital markets.It works in very close partnership with the research partner commercialisation companies and staff, providing a valuable adjunct to the capabilities these companies and staff provide.They in turn provide a best-practice commercialisation service tailored to their respective organisations. These companies are able to leverage to great effect the scale of operation and expertise of the Uniseed network.\\r\\rThe fund is run with commercial discipline, ensuring independence and financial rigor in its investment decision-making processes.Success is measured by a balance of return on investment (including the flow of funds for research to further the commercialisation of intellectual property generated within the research partner catchments), the establishment of viable start-up companies, the generation of research income for research partners and the improvement of partner commercialisation processes.\",\" www.uniseed.com.au \",\" WaterBridge Ventures \",\"55\",\" New Delhi, Delhi, India\",\"WaterBridge Ventures is an early-stage VC’s.

Our thesis is that AI and Robotics will revolutionize productivity in every vertical and unlock human potential.AI and machine learning technology have matured dramatically in just the past few years. The line of what is possible has been pushed back. However, it has become apparent that introducing AI to traditional industries requires a new and more collaborative approach.We started as a fund focused on investing in AI startups, but quickly understood that AI startups have little trouble raising money. Instead, they have a whole assortment of other common needs and challenges with building their businesses.That’s why we didn’t stop at the fund. We created the Labs programs, each providing an environment in which to build and grow companies. We partner with established industry brands to give startups access to vital resources and knowledge that otherwise would be out of reach. Together, we set up programs to help startups and partners discover new insights about how AI and robotics can transform industries like healthcare, agriculture, construction, transportation, and more.We’re always on the lookout for new thoughts and ideas about how AI will impact our society in the not-so-distant future.
