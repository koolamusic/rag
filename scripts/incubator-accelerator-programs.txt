Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) is a no-fee/no-equity organization that delivers an objectives-based mentoring program for massively scalable, pre-seed stage, science- and technology-based companies. Its nine-month program allows founders to learn from experienced entrepreneurs, increasing their likelihood of success. Founded in 2012 by Professor Ajay Agrawal at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, the program has expanded to nine sites across four countries: Oxford (Saïd Business School, University of Oxford), Paris (HEC Paris), Atlanta (Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology), Madison (Wisconsin School of Business, University of Wisconsin-Madison), Vancouver (Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia), Montreal (HEC Montréal), Calgary (Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary), and Halifax (Rowe School of Business, Dalhousie University).Due to the current global COVID-19 crisis, we have adapted our program to be delivered entirely online. As we follow the guidance of public health officials, we will re-evaluate periodically to decide when to transition back to in-person format. CDL will not turn away ventures that have applied to a specific location if they are not able to attend a session in-person, as there is still uncertainty around the COVID-19 situation.\\\

Village Capital uses the power of peer support to change the traditional dynamics between investors and entrepreneurs, providing access to entrepreneurship for everyone.We recruit entrepreneurs solving specific problems in agriculture, energy, education, financial inclusion, and health. We then put the power of investment in the hands of the entrepreneurs, who award pre-committed seed funding to the two ventures ranked highest by the entrepreneurs at the end of every program. Our programs connect high potential, early-stage entrepreneurs with the people, institutions, and capital they need to succeed.We support early-stage ventures with a 501c3 nonprofit that operates training programs for founders, investors, and communities. We also manage a for-profit, managed investment fund that provides early-stage capital to top graduates of each program, as selected by their peers. Our unique peer-selection model received McKinsey/Harvard Business Review’s prestigious M-Prize for innovation in 2013, and we have supported more than 550 enterprises across 51 programs in 9 countries.Since 2009, Village Capital has supported more than 1,000 entrepreneurs through our programs and partnered with affiliated investment funds, including VilCap Investments, that have invested seed capital in more than 90 program graduates.

Our company invests in start-up ventures, and we also hold advisory posts and serve as external directors of some venture companies.\\\\r\\\\rBackground: Social and Economic Legislation\\\\r\\\\rWhereas venture capital investment is at about 30 billion dollars in U.S. and 24 billion dollars in Europe, Japan was only at about 0.86 billion dollars (2005), and the Japanese investment ratio is only about 30 / 1. On the other hand, by the legal deregulation progresses as seen in new business laws, increasingly in the future Japanese funding is expected to expand. \\\\r\\\\rSamurai Incubate Inc. was established to help companies to develop vision and strength and to realize their greater revenue potential. We support practical expertise in marketing and sales management personnel as well as clear financial strategies to monetize our start-ups.\\\\r\\\\rOur company\\\\u0027s name, \\\\\\\

It does not matter whether we can do it or cannot do it. We can change the world by taking action!\\\\\\\

For too long self-motivated entrepreneurs have navigated the minefield of challenges to launching a global company with very little support. The last thing you should bet on in this situation is an unproven team that you don’t trust. GSD Venture Studios travels the world inviting resilient teams to establish partnerships that ensure organizations grow the right way, without games or gimmicks. Unlike traditional investors, we take senior operational (often co-founder) roles in these companies, capitalizing on our trusted reputation, experiences and network to drive explosive growth.We Travel The World Investing In Resilient Teams Bold Enough To #GoGlobalFor companies to leave a lasting impact they must grow quickly, be bold and go global. In order to do so,companies must engineer five things simultaneously: Product, Investment, Influence, Sales/Marketing, and Systems. Benchmarks for future funding rounds must be developed through all five lines of effort. We rarely find companies that are effective at all five, mainly because each line requires a tremendous amount of back office expertise and support. This is why we have partnered with top law firms, banks, coworking spaces, HR professionals and strategists to ensure your success.How We Get Shit DoneFor organizations seeking digital transformation or looking to increase their startup engagement, GSD Venture Studios is developing a collision point with key organizations and officials across the world.We invite corporate partners, accelerators and other experts for idea collaboration, building relationships with our portfolio and helping launch new companies.You Have an Idea, We Make It Global\\\

Over the last 15 years we learned that it is easy to provide playbooks, curriculums, and content and send founders and partners on their way. It is much more difficult to help identify the right problem, ideate the right solution mix, and use channels that fit into the behavior of multiple clients and stakeholders within complex enterprise and/or socioeconomic ecosystems. The lessons taught are just the beginning; the navigation of the land mines ahead is where our support is most valuable along that client journey.We are Memphis based, and the solutions to the economic challenges found in this region can be applicable anywhere.Although Start Co. was founded as a startup accelerator, it is now a design studio serving clients and partners nationally and internationally.Our work will always be found directly in the trenches with the people and communities we serve – to lose touch with them means we would be just another agency or organization.\\\

 Travel Startups Incubator \\\

\\
 Orlando, Florida, United States\\\

\\
We are a niche incubator dedicated 100% to travel technology startups with a focus on mobile travel, leisure travel, in-destination products and services, tours and activities, distribution, web, B2B, travel advertising and corporate business travel.\\\\r\\\\rBuild your startup where you live. We are a virtual incubator. We have office space available for our startups in Dubai, UAE and Manchester, UK with office space in Orlando, FL USA. If you need office space we can provide it for you in these cities. If not we are very comfortable having you build where you live.\\\\r\\\\rNo application deadlines, submit your application when you are ready. We review applications on a rolling basis.\\\\r\\\\rWe are not tied to deadlines like the other larger incubators/accelerators that try to process 1,000+ candidates in 2 weeks, spending only 10-minutes reviewing each application, thus we believe our methodology and approach helps us find the best travel startup founders and their ideas.\\\\r\\\\rIf we like you, the product, the business idea and your team, we will engage with you immediately upon reviewing your application, that’s how we work.\\\\rWe will spend up to 20-hours working with founders in a pre-incubation process prior to funding. This is like a first “dance” where we all get to know one another and make sure Travel Startups Incubator is a fit for not only us but you and your founding team.\\\\r\\\\rPre-incubation is complimentary and includes budget preparation for how you’ll spend the $25,000 cash investment, establishing a plan in how to best utilize the 100-hours of advisement, identifying outcomes for the 6-month incubation, a business model review, a competitive analysis, a technology assessment, mentoring, pitch deck preparation, access to our partners and investors. The pre-incubation process is part of our vetting methodology and preparation for you to enter the incubator.\\\\r\\\\rWe act as a true partner in your startup. Matt Zito a managing partner and the lead advisor will work with your startup providing your team up to 100 hours of advisory assistance within the 6-month incubation helping you build and grow your business. Matt worked with over 25 travel startups as an advisor in 2013 thru the first half of 2014. Matt has successfully built and sold 2 travel companies.\\\\r\\\\rEach startup accepted into the program may receive up to $25,000 in cash and professional advisement services valued at $25,000 over 6-months to help you build your travel startup and to acquire the next round of capital. We will fund you and work with you one-on-one for 6-months. After the 6-month incubation period we will still have your back but in a lesser capacity. We take 12% equity in your startup for our $50,000 investment.\\\\r\\\\rWe have expert domain knowledge in travel technology and travel startups unlike other more larger generalist incubators and accelerators.\\\\r\\\\rEach startup will receive additional advisory and mentoring from former travel entrepreneurs and the leading travel CEO’s active in the marketplace, travel executives and experts in the travel industry.\\\\r\\\\rWe believe we have one of the largest global networks in the travel industry to tap into for business development and resources to take your travel startup to the next level. For example, if we think you need to talk to Google Travel we can arrange this. We are putting corporate partnerships in place with some of the largest travel companies in the world that will give your startup instant traction by gaining access to their customer base and distribution systems.\\\\r\\\\rWe have a legal and accounting team that will assist you in your startup helping you setup a domestic USA corporation.\\\\r\\\\rOur end goal is to get every travel startup we incubate traction that leads to the next round of funding.\\\\r\\\\rWe start promoting your startup to potential investors on day 1 and over the course of the 6-month incubation period. We will be educating investors, telling your story, reporting on your traction and making phone calls on your behalf.\\\\r\\\\rWe are building the worlds largest database of travel investors that have invested in and or invest in travel startups. \\\\r\\\\rWe have access to leading travel software architects, travel technology providers and developers.\\\\r\\\\rOur incubated companies will get PR and promotion assistance through the TravelStartups.co website including a founder interview and blog posts dedicated to your startup.\\\\r\\\\rWe attend multiple travel industry conferences including all the Eye For Travel conferences in the USA where we will promote your startup to investors and business partners we meet.\\\\r\\\\rWe believe we create a competitive advantage for our portfolio companies over other travel startups that choose the larger more broad based incubators, thus we invite you be a part of the Travel Startups Incubator.\\\\r\\\\rAPPLY HERE: http://www.travelstartups.co/travel-startups-incubator\\\

Our Purpose is to promote the development of startups and innovation in companies and organizations which enable an improvement in worldwide nutrition through sustainable production systems.WHAT WE KNOW:The AgriFoodTech sector is completely different from any other. Tech penetration is one of the lowest in the industry and farmer’s willingness to adopt new tech tools cannot be seen as mass consumers in traditional markets.Startups trying to introduce their products in this industry will have to face many challenges, one being the strong seasonality that sometimes allows products to be validated only once a year.Secondly, many times there\\\\u0027s no direct correlation between what the startup is offering and the results that can be achieved by it. A single rain, or the lack of it, can change the impact that a tech solution claims to have in a particular process.Thirdly, farmers have habits and ways of doing business that sometimes doesn\\\\u0027t seem rational, they aren\\\\u0027t willing to pay for services in certain ways despite it would be a no-brainer in any other type of consumer. Because of all the reasons above, investors also have to be much patient than in any other industry.WHAT WE DO:Glocal is the only accelerator focusing on the vertical in the region and because of that the only one with the understanding, network and tools to sort out these challenges.Glocal provides a program that is tailor-made for every startup and that aims to provide them with the tools, network and knowledge about the market that can help them scale their companies.We are at the epicenter of the agricultural region in LatinAmerica and as such all major multinational companies, top brokers and key institutions for the industry are located here.Most of them act not only as Glocal investors but also as mentors and are a gateway to a massive early adopters base.WE LOOK FOR STARTUPS THAT HAVE:- A working product or MVP that sets an innovation for the industry- Done proper validation with their key users- At least one team member with industry knowledge- Make good use of the captured data- A fully commited team- Potential to grow globally\\\

ALMI Invest is a venture capital company which invests in Swedish companies with exciting, scalable business models and motivated entrepreneurs. ALMI Invest consists of eight regionally based venture capital funds, all with local offices and experienced local investment managers. We manage a total of SEK 1 billion.Unlike most venture capitalists, we can invest in a wide range of businesses. A strong team of entrepreneurs, a scalable business model and an initial revenue stream are more important than the line of business when we invest.Our first, initial investment would typically be SEK 2-4 million. During the lifetime of an investment, sums of up to SEK 10 million can be ventured. We always syndicate with an investment partner (another venture capitalist or angel investor) from Sweden or otherwise which means that we can take a maximum of 50 percent of an investment round.ALMI Invest was founded in 2009 by ALMI Fretagspartner together with regional investors. Half of our capital comes from European Union structural funds, which accounts for an investment of SEK 500 million. The other 50 per cent comes from regional investors and ALMI Fretagspartner.\\\

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was established in 1991 when communism was crumbling in central and eastern Europe and ex-soviet countries needed support to nurture a new private sector in a democratic environment. Today the EBRD uses the tools of investment to help build market economies and democracies in countries from central Europe to central Asia.\\\\r\\\\rThe EBRD is the largest single investor in the region and mobilises significant foreign direct investment beyond its own financing. It is owned by 61 countries and two intergovernmental institutions. But despite its public sector shareholders, it invests mainly in private enterprises, usually together with commercial partners.\\\\r\\\\rIt provides project financing for banks, industries and businesses, both new ventures and investments in existing companies. It also works with publicly owned companies, to support privatisation, restructuring state-owned firms and improvement of municipal services. The Bank uses its close relationship with governments in the region to promote policies that will bolster the business environment.\\\\r\\\\rThe mandate of the EBRD stipulates that it must only work in countries that are committed to democratic principles. Respect for the environment is part of the strong corporate governance attached to all EBRD investments.\\\

The United States has a long history of extending a helping hand to people overseas struggling to make a better life. It is a history that both advances U.S. foreign policy interests as well as reflects the American people\\\\u0027s compassion and support of human dignity. USAID extends help from the American people to achieve results for the poorest and most vulnerable around the world. That assistance does not represent a Democratic value or a Republican value, but an American value; as beneficiaries of peace and prosperity, Americans have a responsibility to assist those less fortunate so we see the day when assistance is no longer necessary.\\\

 U.S. Small Business Administration \\\

\\
30\\\

\\
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) was created in 1953 as an independent agency of the federal government to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small business concerns, to preserve free competitive enterprise and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of our nation. We recognize that small business is critical to our economic recovery and strength, to building America\\\\u0027s future, and to helping the United States compete in today\\\\u0027s global marketplace. Although SBA has grown and evolved in the years since it was established in 1953, the bottom line mission remains the same. The SBA helps Americans start, build and grow businesses. Through an extensive network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations, SBA delivers its services to people throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U. S. Virgin Islands and Guam.\\\\r\\\\rOverview \\\\u0026 History\\\\r\\\\rSince its founding on July 30, 1953, the U.S. Small Business Administration has delivered millions of loans, loan guarantees, contracts, counseling sessions and other forms of assistance to small businesses.\\\\r\\\\rThe SBA was officially established in 1953, but its philosophy and mission began to take shape years earlier in a number of predecessor agencies, largely as a response to the pressures of the Great Depression and World War II.\\\\r\\\\rThe Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), created by President Herbert Hoover in 1932 to alleviate the financial crisis of the Great Depression, was SBA\\\\u0027s grandparent.The RFC was basically a federal lending program for all businesses hurt by the Depression, large and small.It was adopted as the personal project of Hoover\\\\u0027s successor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and was staffed by some of Roosevelt\\\\u0027s most capable and dedicated workers.\\\\r\\\\rConcern for small business intensified during World War II, when large industries beefed up production to accommodate wartime defense contracts and smaller businesses were left unable to compete.To help small business participate in war production and give them financial viability, Congress created the Smaller War Plants Corporation (SWPC) in 1942.The SWPC provided direct loans to private entrepreneurs, encouraged large financial institutions to make credit available to small enterprises, and advocated small business interests to federal procurement agencies and big businesses.\\\\r\\\\rThe SWPC was dissolved after the war, and its lending and contract powers were handed over to the RFC.At this time, the Office of Small Business (OSB) in the Department of Commerce also assumed some responsibilities that would later become characteristic duties of the SBA. Its services were primarily educational.Believing that a lack of information and expertise was the main cause of small business failure, the OSB produced brochures and conducted management counseling for individual entrepreneurs.\\\\r\\\\rCongress created another wartime organization to handle small business concerns during the Korean War, this time called the Small Defense Plants Administration (SDPA).Its functions were similar to those of the SWPC, except that ultimate lending authority was retained by the RFC. The SDPA certified small businesses to the RFC when it had determined the businesses to be competent to perform the work of government contracts.\\\\r\\\\rBy 1952, a move was on to abolish the RFC. To continue the important functions of the earlier agencies, President Dwight Eisenhower proposed creation of a new small business agency -- the Small Business Administration (SBA).\\\\r\\\\rIn the Small Business Act of July 30, 1953, Congress created the Small Business Administration, whose function was to \\\\\\\
aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns.\\\\\\\
 The charter also stipulated that the SBA would ensure small businesses a \\\\\\\
fair proportion\\\\\\\
 of government contracts and sales of surplus property.\\\\r\\\\rBy 1954, SBA already was making direct business loans and guaranteeing bank loans to small businesses, as well as making loans to victims of natural disasters, working to get government procurement contracts for small businesses and helping business owners with management and technical assistance and business training.\\\\r\\\\rThe Investment Company Act of 1958 established the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) Program, under which SBA licensed, regulated and helped provide funds for privately owned and operated venture capital investment firms. They specialized in providing long-term debt and equity investments to high-risk small businesses. Its creation was the result of a Federal Reserve study that discovered, in the simplest terms, that small businesses could not get the credit they needed to keep pace with technological advancement.\\\\r\\\\rIn 1964, SBA began to attack poverty through the Equal Opportunity Loan (EOL) Program. The EOL Program relaxed the credit and collateral requirements for applicants living below the poverty level in an effort to encourage new businesses that had been unable to attract financial backing, but were nevertheless sound commercial initiatives.\\\\r\\\\rSBA has grown in terms of total assistance provided and its array of programs tailored to encourage small enterprises in all areas.SBA\\\\u0027s programs now include financial and federal contract procurement assistance, management assistance, and specialized outreach to women, minorities and armed forces veterans. The SBA also provides loans to victims of natural disasters and specialized advice and assistance in international trade.\\\

The government of the United States of America is the federal government of the republic of fifty states that constitute the United States, as well as one capital district, and several other territories.\\\\r\\\\r\\\\rThe federal government is composed of three distinct branches: legislative, executive and judicial, whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the congress, the president, and the federal courts, including the Supreme Court, respectively. The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress, including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court.\\\\r\\\\r\\\\rThe outline of the government of the United States is laid out in the Constitution. The government was formed in 1789, making the United States the first modern national constitutional republic. The executive power in the federal government is vested in the President of the United States, although power is often delegated to the Cabinet members and other officials. The President and Vice President are elected as running mates by the Electoral College, for which each state, as well as the District of Columbia, is allocated a number of seats based on its representation (or ostensible representation, in the case of D.C.) in both houses of Congress. The President is limited to a maximum of two four-year terms. If the President has already served two years or more of a term to which some other person was elected, he may only serve one more additional four-year term.\\\

 Innovation Fund Serbia \\\

\\
 Belgrade, Vojvodina, Serbia\\\

\\
Serbia was one of the first countries in the region to embrace the so-called “innovation imperative”, that is the notion that successful participation in the global knowledge economy requires the ability to adapt and advance new technological and research capabilities that involve public and private collaboration.Operational since 2011, the Innovation Fund has been a pioneering effort to operationalize and institutionalize this imperative – first by increasing the capacity of startups and resources available for their growth. It is part of a broader innovation strategy now under development.The intention of the Innovation Fund is to contribute to the overall development of innovations through various financial aid instruments, particularly by fostering the establishment of new and strengthening the existing companies, by positioning them to access venture capital markets, and by attracting foreign direct investment in the high-tech research and development.Innovation Fund aims to promote linkages between research and technology development and economy, and encourage and support the development of innovative technologies.The EU’s support for the Innovation Fund has been instrumental in advancing Serbia’s innovation financing and promoting better integration between the research and private sectors. The Fund is thus an important step towards closer links between Serbia’s and EU’s research communities and innovation ecosystems. It enables the positioning of Serbia as a leader in the region and the establishment of links with the EU and global markets. So far, the EU has allocated around EUR 13 million from the IPA funds to the Innovation Fund.\\\

Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), a public limited liability company, was established as a bank holding company in 1985 under a private sector initiative spearheaded by the Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce and Industry with the support of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). In the early 1980’s foreign and state-owned banks dominated the banking industry in West Africa. Commercial banks in West Africa owned and managed by the African private sector were a rarity. Its founders created ETI with the objective of filling this vacuum.\\\\r\\\\rThe Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce promoted and initiated a project to create a private, regional banking institution in West Africa. In 1984, Ecopromotions S.A. was incorporated. Its founding shareholders raised seed capital for feasibility studies and the promotional activities leading to the creation of ETI.\\\\r\\\\rIn October 1985, ETI was incorporated with authorised capital of US$100 million. The initial paid up capital of US$32 million was raised from over 1,500 individuals and institutions from West African countries. The largest shareholder was the ECOWAS Fund for Cooperation, Compensation and Development (ECOWAS Fund), the development finance arm of ECOWAS.\\\\r\\\\rEcobank signed a Headquarters’ Agreement with the Government of Togo in 1985, which granted it the status of an international organisation. This status came with the rights and privileges necessary for ETI to operate as a regional institution, including the status of a non-resident financial institution. ETI commenced operations with its first subsidiary in Togo in March 1988.\\\

 Skolkovo Innovation Center \\\

\\
 Moscow, Moscow City, Russian Federation\\\

\\
The Skolkovo Innovation Center is a planned high technology business area being built at Skolkovo near Moscow, Russia. The site aims to be a highly modern complex created to encourage science and technology companies. Although historically Russia has been successful with development of science and technology, its lack of entrepreneur spirit led to government intervention of patents and nonproliferation of Russian tech companies beyond the scope of regional service. This site is tasked with not only the development of technology start-ups but also marketing them correctly. As corporations and individuals become \\\\\\\
residents\\\\\\\
 of the city, proposed projects and ideas receive financial assistance. Skolkovo was announced on 12 November 2009 by then Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. The complex is headed by Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg and co-chaired by former Intel CEO Craig Barrett.\\\

 Government of the Republic of Rwanda \\\

\\
For centuries, Rwanda existed as a centralized monarchy under a succession of Tutsi kings from one clan, who ruled through cattle chiefs, land chiefs and military chiefs. The king was supreme but the rest of the population, Bahutu, Batutsi and Batwa, lived in symbiotic harmony. In 1899, Rwanda became a German colony and, in 1919, the system of indirect rule continued with Rwanda as a mandate territory of the League of Nations, under Belgium.\\\

 Morongo Band of Mission Indians \\\

\\
 Banning, California, United States\\\

\\
Established in 1865,the Morongo Indian Reservation was one of nine small reservations created by President Ulysses S. Grant by executive order in 1876. In 1983, the path of Morongo\\\\u0027s future changed when tribal members started a modest bingo hall. From this building evolved one of the oldest and most successful Indian gaming facilities in California. The present $250 million destination which opened in late 2004, the Morongo Casino, Resort \\\\u0026 Spa, is one of the largest tribal gaming facilities in the nation.\\\\rWith its diversification into non-gaming businesses, the tribe has become the largest private sector employer in the Banning-Beaumont region and is a major contributor to the Coachella Valley economy. The tribe now employs more than 3,000 people. An independent study reported that the tribe\\\\u0027s gaming and non-gaming businesses would generate more than $2.8 billion into the regional economy by 2008. The tribe pays payroll taxes, unemployment benefits, employee benefits and provides health programs. More than two thirds of the Morongo workforce is composed of residents from the Banning Pass and desert cities.\\\

Over the last 15 years we learned that it is easy to provide playbooks, curriculums, and content and send founders and partners on their way. It is much more difficult to help identify the right problem, ideate the right solution mix, and use channels that fit into the behavior of multiple clients and stakeholders within complex enterprise and/or socioeconomic ecosystems. The lessons taught are just the beginning; the navigation of the land mines ahead is where our support is most valuable along that client journey.We are Memphis based, and the solutions to the economic challenges found in this region can be applicable anywhere.Although Start Co. was founded as a startup accelerator, it is now a design studio serving clients and partners nationally and internationally.Our work will always be found directly in the trenches with the people and communities we serve – to lose touch with them means we would be just another agency or organization.\\\

 GLOCAL \\\

\\
Our Purpose is to promote the development of startups and innovation in companies and organizations which enable an improvement in worldwide nutrition through sustainable production systems.WHAT WE KNOW:The AgriFoodTech sector is completely different from any other. Tech penetration is one of the lowest in the industry and farmer’s willingness to adopt new tech tools cannot be seen as mass consumers in traditional markets.Startups trying to introduce their products in this industry will have to face many challenges, one being the strong seasonality that sometimes allows products to be validated only once a year.Secondly, many times there\\\\u0027s no direct correlation between what the startup is offering and the results that can be achieved by it. A single rain, or the lack of it, can change the impact that a tech solution claims to have in a particular process.Thirdly, farmers have habits and ways of doing business that sometimes doesn\\\\u0027t seem rational, they aren\\\\u0027t willing to pay for services in certain ways despite it would be a no-brainer in any other type of consumer. Because of all the reasons above, investors also have to be much patient than in any other industry.WHAT WE DO:Glocal is the only accelerator focusing on the vertical in the region and because of that the only one with the understanding, network and tools to sort out these challenges.Glocal provides a program that is tailor-made for every startup and that aims to provide them with the tools, network and knowledge about the market that can help them scale their companies.We are at the epicenter of the agricultural region in LatinAmerica and as such all major multinational companies, top brokers and key institutions for the industry are located here.Most of them act not only as Glocal investors but also as mentors and are a gateway to a massive early adopters base.WE LOOK FOR STARTUPS THAT HAVE:- A working product or MVP that sets an innovation for the industry- Done proper validation with their key users- At least one team member with industry knowledge- Make good use of the captured data- A fully commited team- Potential to grow globally\\\
