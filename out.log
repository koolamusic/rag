Startups working across almost all areas of science and technology can receive up to $1.5 million in non-dilutive funds to support research and development (R\\\\\\\\u0026D), helping de-risk technology for commercial success. America’s Seed Fund is congressionally mandated through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.

        'Creative Destruction Lab (CDL) is a no-fee/no-equity organization that delivers an objectives-based mentoring program for massively scalable, pre-seed stage, science- and technology-based companies. Its nine-month program allows founders to learn from experienced entrepreneurs, increasing their likelihood of success. Founded in 2012 by Professor Ajay Agrawal at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, the program has expanded to nine sites across four countries: Oxford (Saïd Business School, University of Oxford), Paris (HEC Paris), Atlanta (Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology), Madison (Wisconsin School of Business, University of Wisconsin-Madison), Vancouver (Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia), Montreal (HEC Montréal), Calgary (Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary), and Halifax (Rowe School of Business, Dalhousie University).Due to the current global COVID-19 crisis, we have adapted our program to be delivered entirely online. As we follow the guidance of public health officials, we will re-evaluate periodically to decide when to transition back to in-person format. CDL will not turn away ventures that have applied to a specific location if they are not able to attend a session in-person, as there is still uncertainty around the COVID-19 situation.\\\\\\\n' +
